## Approach

- The project splits different card types into separate card components to keep the code organized and easy to manage.

- Card content is defined using TypeScript interfaces to make sure the data is consistent and easy to work with.

- The UI is built using shadcn components and the icons are provided by the Lucide library.

- The dashboard supports dark mode implemented using shadecn's theme support.
